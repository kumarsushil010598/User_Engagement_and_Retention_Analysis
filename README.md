# User_Engagement_and_Retention_Analysis
The User Login Activity Analysis System is a database-driven project designed to manage 
and analyse user login activities for a business application. The system tracks user 
information and their login sessions, enabling the business to derive insights into user 
engagement, session trends, and activity patterns. The project involves two primary tables: 
users and logins, with SQL queries developed to address specific business requirements 
such as identifying inactive users, analysing quarterly session trends, and recognizing top
performing users based on session scores and consistency.
